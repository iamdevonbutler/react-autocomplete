React Autocomplete
==================

Fork of react-autocomplete.

Adds `onBlur` and `onFocus` event handling. Uses React DOM to fix React 1.4 error messages. That's it.

npm i --save react-autocomplete-with-onBlur-onFocus

---

Accessible, extensible, Autocomplete for React.js.

Docs coming soon, for now just look at the `propTypes` and examples :)

Trying to settle on the right API, and then focus hard on accessibility,
there are a few missing bits right now.

Stuff we need help with:

- mobile support verification generally
- default mobile styles/positioniong (you'll notice the styles are
  pretty lean, on purpose, apps should style this however they'd like)
- tests (eventually)
